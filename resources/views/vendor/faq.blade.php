            How much is cost for magic show?
		</span>
		<span class="answer-text">
            My charge will depend on your demand. Example the type of event, when is your party, how long you want show for and where is the party. With all details you can pickup phone, it will be better to discuss with magician direct. My service is not cheap, but I guarantee you’ll get a special service with me. While you hire me for adult event, where there will be a few kids present, I’ll be able to entertain them with many items along with the adults. But if you’re specifically looking for a kid’s party, let me know, I’m a specialist children’s entertainer. I have other services for them as well. Just ask me.
